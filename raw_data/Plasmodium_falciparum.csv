The anti-PfBet3p reactivity is confined to regions within the parasite compartment. There was no labelling of compartments within the RBC cytoplasm as has been reported previously for COPII proteins and for antigen 41-2 (Knapp et al., 1989).

A confocal slice taken near the surface of the infected erythrocyte provided evidence that the punctate structures are often closely connected to the erythrocyte membrane (Fig. 4b). In more mature stage-infected erythrocytes, the localisation of PfSec31p in compartments within the erythrocyte cytosol was more marked. An uneven or polarised labelling pattern was still observed within the parasite cytoplasm, but PfSec31p appeared to be largely associated with structures in the erythrocyte cytosol that appear vesicular in nature (Fig. 4c,d).
