"Eimeria ascervulina"	"MORN1"	"no matching gene model found"	18310354	"IMC during daughter cell formation, not during macrogamete, nuclear pole during proliferative microgametocyte, flagellar basal bodies during flagellate growth, electron dense collar and adjacent to mitochondrion during microgametogeny, anterior adjacent to mitochondria during mature microgametogeny and free microgamete"			"polyclonal antibody to homologue"	"However, in the small schizonts of E. acervulina, it was easier to follow the morphological changes. It was observed that after fragmentation of the apicoplast (Fig. 3G), the individual small apicoplast reoriented to become associated with the nuclei located beneath the MORN1-positive plaques (Fig. 3H). In more tangential sections, the plaques appeared as closely packed, ring-like structures (Fig. 3I). As the daughters grow, the MORN1-positive rings appear to move over the nuclei (Fig. 3J) and end with strongly positive posterior staining, where the daughters remain connected to the residual cytoplasm (Fig. 3K and L). This strong labeling of the posterior ring was also confirmed in the late stages of merozoite formation in E. tenella by electron microscopy (Fig. 4F and G). However, with detachment and release of the mature merozoites, it appeared that the strong posterior staining was greatly reduced, although the nuclear pole was still stained (data not shown). .. Sexual development was studied across four coccidian species: T. gondii, E acervulina, E. tenella, and E. maxima. They developed in similar manners and varied only in size and the number of gametes formed. Therefore, coccidian sexual development will be represented in a combined description without differentiating between the species."
