PDI	PCAS_093520	19615402	cytoplasm and nuclear during blood stages	blast from AY769864, annotation matches	Light	monoclonal antibody	Results obtained for the intracellular localization of PcPDI in P. chabaudi-iRBC by IFA (Fig 5) showed that the labeling appeared spotted around the nucleus as well in the parasite cytoplasm. The PDI was also recognized by the mAbs in all the erythrocytic stages analyzed, Fig 5: late trophozoite h); schizont with merozoites e) and young schizont b). PcPDI localization seems restricted to the parasite cells suggesting that the selected mAbs give a fluorescence pattern similar to that described in P. falciparum [43]. 	AS		
Pc(em)93	no matching gene model found	9256443	PV and not ER and not nucleus	blast from U80896, annotation matches	Light	monoclonal antibody	P. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes were treated with BFA and examined by postembedding localization with mAb 13.5. Examination of unstained grids under low voltage reveals a colocalization of gold particles with a distinct intraparasitic compartment. â€¦ However, the sERA is clearly distinct from the ER as demonstrated by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1).	54X		
SBP1	no matching gene model found	11087921	Maurer's Cleft during intraerythrocytic	blast from homologue PFE0065w	Light, EM	polyclonal antibody directly to protein	The carboxy-terminal domain of Pfsbp1, exposed within the cytoplasm of the host cell, interacts with a 35 kDa erythrocyte skeletal protein and might participate in the binding of the Maurer's clefts to the erythrocyte submembrane skeleton.
