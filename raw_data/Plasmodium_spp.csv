"Plasmodium gallinaceum"	"PgCHT1"	"AF064079.1"	15069061	"microneme lumen and not surface during ookinete"		"light, EM"	"antibody direct to protein"	"Within the microneme CTRP was associated peripherally at the microneme membrane, whereas PgCHT1 and WARP were diffuse within the micronemal lumen. … In contrast, PgCHT1, a protein that is not cell surface-associated and lacks predicted transmembrane domains, was found soluble within the central lumen of the same micronemes as those containing CTRP (small (5 nm) gold dots)."

"8A"	"not sequenced in publication, and blasting epitope LYDSYAYYGKKYD against the incomplete P. gallinaceum genome only gives a single hit.

"Plasmodium gallinaceum"	"PgSES"	"DQ068022"	16697061	"nuclear during early ring and schizont, during troph, weak during oocyst sporozoite, spiralling on surface during salivary gland sporozoite"	"taken directly from publication"			"The PgSES protein appears to have some co-localization with the nuclear stain in both the early ring and schizont stages … Thus, the PgSES protein appears to be expressed at a very low level in oocyst sporozoites as shown by IFA and immuno-blot analyses, where the latter demonstrated that there was no detectable PgSES protein in the oocyst sporozoite sample even though comparable numbers of salivary gland sporozoites produced an observable protein product. … The PgSES protein localizes to the surface of salivary gland sporozoites with a unique spiral labeling pattern as determined by confocal microscopy."

Salivary gland sporozoites and budding sporozoites in mature oocysts were labeled uniformly on the outer surface of their plasma membranes. The surface of sporozoites that ruptured into midgut epithelial cells were entirely covered with gold particles."
