"Plasmodium gallinaceum"	"PgCHT1"	"AF064079.1"	15069061	"microneme lumen and not surface during ookinete"		"light, EM"	"antibody direct to protein"	"Within the microneme CTRP was associated peripherally at the microneme membrane, whereas PgCHT1 and WARP were diffuse within the micronemal lumen. … In contrast, PgCHT1, a protein that is not cell surface-associated and lacks predicted transmembrane domains, was found soluble within the central lumen of the same micronemes as those containing CTRP (small (5 nm) gold dots)."

"8A"	"not sequenced in publication, and blasting epitope LYDSYAYYGKKYD against the incomplete P. gallinaceum genome only gives a single hit.

Salivary gland sporozoites and budding sporozoites in mature oocysts were labeled uniformly on the outer surface of their plasma membranes. The surface of sporozoites that ruptured into midgut epithelial cells were entirely covered with gold particles."
