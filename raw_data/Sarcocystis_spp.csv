"#Sarcocystis ovifelis"	"AS"	"AS activity was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, lysosomes and micronemes of cyst cells. Of interest is the finding of AS in the outer membrane of IC and matrix of pellicular evaginations. In the cyst ground substance (CGS) of S. ovifelis AS activity is confined to the membrane and matrix of transport vesicles, originating from cyst cell pellicle evaginations."	9381560
