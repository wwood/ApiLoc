"Light"	"polyclonal antibody directly to protein"	"TaSE was found to be localized inside the parasite, the parasite membrane and within the host cell cytoplasm. Moreover, it co-localized at distinct points with host cell microtubules, which was especially apparent during mitosis, where co-localization was found with the centromere, the mitotic spindle and the midbody."
