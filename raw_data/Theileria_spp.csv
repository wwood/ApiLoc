"Theileria lestoquardi"	"clone-5"	"DQ004498"	16896652	"plasma membrane during macroschizont"		"light"	"polyclonal antibody "	"The nature of the staining of the infected cells and isolated schizonts was similar to the pattern known for staining of Theileria schizont surface proteins (TaSP, Schnittger et al. 2002), with the highest intensity of staining localized to the schizont membrane. No apparent host cell cytoplasmic or nuclear staining could be detected. In the isolated schizonts (Fig.Â 3), clone-5 protein was also detectable in the cytoplasm, however, nuclear staining was also not evident"	"Atbara"	"at least two splice variants exist for this gene"
