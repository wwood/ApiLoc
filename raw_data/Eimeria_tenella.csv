"Light"	"polyclonal antibody directly to protein"	"(A) Intracellular sporozoites show apical staining. (B,C) Developing and enlarging schizonts, which still have the central refractile body and no merozoite differentiation, do not stain. (D) In maturing schizonts, as merozoites bud from the schizont, EtMIC4 staining is seen in the central region and around the edge, where the merozoite tips are located. (E) As the schizont reaches bursting point, staining is clearly associated with the apical tips of the merozoites. ... We examined the surface localisation and secretion of EtMIC4, together with that of EtMIC1, another sporozoite microneme protein which contains TSP-1-like repeats and has the same conserved TM-CT sequence as EtMIC4. In methanol-permeabilised, freshly-hatched sporozoites ( Fig. 5), it can be seen that both EtMIC1 and EtMIC4 are localised predominantly within the apical tip of the parasite. However, in paraformaldehyde-fixed, non-permeabilised sporozoites, EtMIC4 is readily detected on the surface, whereas EtMIC1 staining is absent."	"Wis"

There is no surface staining of parasites fixed with PFA. However, when sporozoites are added to host cells ( Fig. 3C), EtMIC 5 is clearly detectable on the surface of PFA-fixed extracellular sporozoites (Esp), most dominantly at the apical end. In contrast, intracellular sporozoites (Isp) do not stain, demonstrating the efficacy of the PFA treatment for cross-linking plasma membranes. ... After invasion, EtMIC 5 is found within the sporozoite, concentrated mainly at the apical tip. As sporozoites develop into immature schizonts (Panels BﾖD, note the single, fused refractile body diagnostic of early schizogony), EtMIC 5 is initially found throughout the whole schizont (Fig. 4B) then disperses ( Fig. 4C) and eventually disappears ( Fig. 4D). This staining sequence suggests that EtMIC 5 in the early schizont represents residual protein that was brought in by the invading sporozoite. No further staining is seen until late in schizogony, after nuclear division and cytoplasmic differentiation, when daughter merozoites are nearing maturation. EtMIC 5 is then detected strongly at the periphery of the schizont ( Fig. 4E) and is clearly associated with the apical third of the newly formed merozoites ( Fig. 4F)."

In some cases, the trail finished abruptly just before the point of parasite invasion ( Fig. 2b) and some newly infected cells could be seen to have EtMIC2 dispersed all over their surface ( Fig. 2c).

Mature second-generation schizonts were obtained after intestinal scrapings of four-day infected chickens. A specific staining at the apex of the second-generation neoformed merozoites was also shown inside the schizont with mAb A6 (Fig. 3D).
