As the ookinete develops by forming a protrusion of the spherical zygote, a developmental stage called retort, strong fluorescence became localized to the periphery of the protrusion corresponding to the newly forming ookinete but not to the zygote part of the retort (Fig. 3). These observations argue against the targeting of IMC1b to the plasma membrane; in this scenario the protein would be localized to the periphery of entire retort, which is clearly not the case. We also studied the process of ookinete-to-oocyst transformation. This starts with the development of a round protrusion midway along the ookinete, a developmental stage called took. These protrusions were devoid of peripheral fluorescence (Fig. 3), indicating that IMC/SPN are absent from this part of the cell. As the rounding-up process of the ookinete completes, young spherical oocysts form; these displayed peripheral fluorescence only in part of the cell (Fig. 3).

Later, when male gametes were emerging from the residual body of the male gametocyte, PbPF16-GFP was clearly localised to the emerging male gamete and had patchy distribution along the length of the gamete; moreover it appeared that PbPF16-GFP was always encompassed within the axonemal fluorescence (Figure 2).
